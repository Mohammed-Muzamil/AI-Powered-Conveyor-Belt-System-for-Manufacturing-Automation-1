### **‚öôÔ∏è AI-Powered Conveyor Belt System for Manufacturing Automation**

This project aims to enhance manufacturing efficiency by automating conveyor belt operations using AI-based computer vision and real-time object tracking. By identifying, counting, and classifying items on the conveyor, the system enables intelligent sorting, defect detection, and optimized control of the belt‚Äôs speed and direction. This minimizes human intervention, reduces error rates, and increases production throughput.

### **üì∏ How It Works**

1. **Capture Input**: Live video feed from a camera over the conveyor belt.
2. **Detect Objects**: Use object detection to recognize and classify items.
3. **Process Decisions**: Identify defects or sort objects based on type or size.
4. **Control Conveyor**: Adjust speed, trigger diverters, or activate actuators.
5. **Repeat in Real-Time** for continuous automation and smart control.
